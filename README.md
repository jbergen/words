# words.text

This is a collection of lists of different types of words in .txt format.

This is **not** an exhaustive list or dictionary! These words are curated to be interesting and not (too) obscure.

## What do I do with this?

Generate weird sentence. Make a flashcards. …idk. I'm keeping these lists agnostic to any sort of technology and file type (.txt excepted) so they can be used and modified in as many contexts as you might dream up!

## Accepting contributions

I'd love to have your contributions! Feel free to fork/clone this repo to your heart's content. But if that doesn't suffice, then submit a pull request.

- Additional lists/taxonomies will be considered

- Please keep words in alphabetical order and one entry per line

- **Please only modify one file per pull request**. This will help keep the requests and feedback focused and orderly.
